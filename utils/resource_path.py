"""
Helper for PyInstaller resource paths.

When running as a bundled executable, PyInstaller extracts data files to a
temporary folder referenced by sys._MEIPASS. This helper returns the correct
path whether running from source or from a bundled executable.

Usage:
    from utils.resource_path import resource_path
    
    icon_path = resource_path("assets/icon.ico")
    config_path = resource_path("config/settings.json")

    Args:

    Returns:
